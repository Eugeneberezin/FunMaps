Maps with Directions and Google Places
All about setting up Maps using the MapKit framework from Apple. I'll look at drawing annotation pins on the map, displaying the user's location, displaying directions between different places, and integrating the Google Places SDK.
I am using combination of MapKit, UIKit and SwiftUI.
